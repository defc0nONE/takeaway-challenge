Takeaway Challenge
==================

Planned Design
==================
4 classes - Takeaway, Menu, Order and TextMessage

Outcome
==================
This is my submission for the W2 weekend challenge at Makers Academy. After an insane, unexpected and emotionally draining weekend, I'm submitting incomplete as I'm not currently in the right mind state to finish this challenge to my own satisfaction and would rather ensure that I'm giving it my best shot as opposed to panic cramming and spiking just to say I completed it.

Spare time permitting (wishful thinking, perhaps), I would love to see this through, revisit this and deliver a MVP.
